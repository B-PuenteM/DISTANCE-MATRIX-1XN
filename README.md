# DISTANCE-MATRIX-1XN
The Distance Matrix API is a service that provides travel distance and time for a matrix of origins and destinations. The API returns information based on the recommended route between start and end points, as calculated by the Google Maps API, and consists of rows containing duration and distance values for each pair. The reason for this code being 1xN is that it will compute distances between a singe 1xN origin destination table. This can be usefull to compute distances from a single origin to multiple destinations, or to obtain individual distances between desired origin destination coordinates.
